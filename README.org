* About this project
This project is based on [[https://github.com/WiiLink24/guilded-bridge ][another project]]. I noticed it had some flaws, and some parts just outdated, so I decided to continue the project here.

* Installation
Using this project is simple, follow the steps.

** You need...
+ A working system (Linux or MacOS is preferred. Windows'll work too).
+ Some basic knowledge on Guilded flowbots, and the Discord API.
+ Python, nothing'll work otherwise.

*** You must create
+ A Guilded flowbot, and have its token.
+ A Discord bot, and have its token.
+ A Guilded and Discord webhook, and have their URLs ready.
+ A channel on both sides to bridge.

** Installing dependencies
This project depends on some python packages, you can install them with this command.
#+begin_example sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
#+end_example

** Setting up environment variables
We need to let the bot know the parts to bridge, you must edit the `env-example` file, and rename it to `.env`.
Here's what it looks like
#+begin_example sh
DISCORD_TOKEN=
DISCORD_WEBHOOK=
DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=
DISCORD_STATUS=

GUILDED_TOKEN=
GUILDED_WEBHOOK=
#+end_example

** Running the bot
You should be all set! If this doesn't work, you can contact me on my [[https://guilded.gg/fts/][Guilded]] or [[https://dsc.gg/freetech/][Discord]] server.
#+begin_example sh
python3 launch.py
#+end_example

* Windows users
This project was made to be run on Linux or MacOS. If you're on Windows, there's a few things you need to change.

** Python
The way you run Python varies by OS. If `python3` doesn't work, replace it with `py` or `python`.

** Guilded.py
Guilded.py may not work on your Windows system, as far as we've tested.
